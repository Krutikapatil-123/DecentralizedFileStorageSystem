# Decentralized File Storage System

## Project Title
Decentralized File Storage System

## Project Description
The Decentralized File Storage System is a blockchain-based solution designed to provide a secure and decentralized approach to storing and accessing files. Built on the Stellar blockchain, the system leverages smart contracts to manage file permissions, encryption, and storage agreements. This ensures that users retain full control over their data while enhancing privacy and security.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to empower users with a decentralized platform for file storage that eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries. By leveraging the Stellar blockchain, we aim to create a trustless system where users can store and access their files with enhanced privacy, security, and transparency. The platform will serve as a robust alternative to traditional cloud storage solutions, offering greater control over data and permissions.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Storage**: Files are stored across multiple nodes, ensuring redundancy and availability without reliance on a single provider.
- **Smart Contract Management**: Stellar-based smart contracts manage file permissions, encryption keys, and storage agreements.
- **Enhanced Security**: End-to-end encryption is enforced, ensuring that only authorized users can access stored files.
- **Immutable Records**: Every transaction, storage update, or permission change is recorded immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and auditability.
- **File Access Control**: Smart contracts allow fine-grained access control, enabling users to manage who can view, download, or modify stored files.
- **Cost Efficiency**: The use of blockchain technology minimizes the cost of storage by cutting out traditional third-party storage providers and offering a decentralized marketplace for storage resources.
